	<description>An item tagging system by Chief_Curtains, based on TagIt by Colinfang and Favourites by XeoNovaDan 

I created this mod following several hours of frustration when dealing with my Pawns equipping, eating, storing, and just generally being frustrating in regards to items that I would like more specific control over. Specifically when it comes to infusions from Infused 2 with stats that are irrelevant to the pawn that decided to equip them. 

This C# in this mod is HEAVILY inspired by the work of Colinfang's "TagIt" and XeoNovaDan's "Favourites!". I added comments in the source file referencing code that was borrowed from XeoNovaDan's work. Thank you again for sharing your source online!

&lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description,Concerns, and Compatibility &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;

- Twelve tags have been added which can be applied to Pawns, Items, Minified Buildings, Cat Girls, Manure, whatever works for you!
- As of this version, the tags are stastic A through L.
- The stockpile, apparel, and food restrictions work as expected. If you tag it, they will come (or not come, I guess).
- There is one mod setting and it flicks off the overlay. It was very hard to make for some reason, try it out!
- The mod is safe to add mid game. I would not reccommend removal, but I doubt it will have any major negative effects. That is your risk to take.
- I will post the source eventually, I don't feel like the skeletons in my closet are ready to be seen by the world (they haven't been tagged).
- The mod has a very light influence on the save file. It will simply add a value to any tagged item, following the format &lt;color=green&gt;&lt;b&gt;"ccrt_itemATag" &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;. This was to make save cleaning easier and I wish more modders would follow this standard when their code scribes to the save file.
- THIS IS NOT AN INCOMPATIBILITY! So far, I have only seen a minor issue with Allow-Tool that requires my mod to be loaded AFTER it. I made sure to put that into the About.xml so that the auto-sorter would clear it up. I think this is simply a Harmony issue and I am far too simple minded to address it properly. Allow-Tool seems to REALLY like to take ownership of a specific spot on the bottom and it does not take kindly to others imposing on it. 

&lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Follow-Up &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt;

I plan to update the mod to allow for user specified tag colors and names, but that is beyond my current C# knowledge (I just started coding C# 4 days ago as of this release...).

If you have any issues, hit me up on Steam and I will try to help after pretending I am too busy to reply to your message. 

Enjoy!</description>
